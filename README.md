# Cellular Automata

You can start by cloning this repository. 

Install Docker and build the docker image. You can use the shell script which will mount your working directory and run the daemonized container.

The advantage to this set up is that it is 100% reproducible and portable.

You can then navigate and explore with me as I continue to try to make sense of the Cellular Automata.
